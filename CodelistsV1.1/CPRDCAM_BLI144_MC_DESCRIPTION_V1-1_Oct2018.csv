Source: The Scottish ISD list was used to sensitise an iterative search of Readcode lists and terms using the code browser.  It was decided to omit ""O/E…"" terms as these may describe temporary acute symptoms.  Poor vision/blindness registration codes and ""F4…"" codes describing longstanding visual problems were included.  Apart from neurological blindness specific (non-blindness) opthalmology diagnoses were not included as the commonest ones are typically not related to blindness.  This list is likely to be specific and it is possible an opthalmologist could suggest further terms that would improve sensitivity a little. Glaucoma per se is not included.",,,109,"510;555;1444;1990;2746;3851;3976;6020;6661;6768;7203;8367;9342;9645;10868;12493;13152;15269;18819;20256;20585;20607;23742;25168;25547;25831;26722;29387;32044;32467;33014;33015;33016;33017;33447;34957;35515;37086;37893;38000;38166;38167;38168;40451;41060;42262;44954;45030;45786;47158;47911;47912;47956;48983;49283;50679;50925;51274;54513;54514;54962;55108;55436;55844;56574;57631;58787;60032;60043;60078;60401;62657;63045;63298;63732;63928;65144;65569;66372;66391;66731;67296;67594;67765;67872;68386;68391;69998;71319;72411;73224;73534;96455;98637;98672;99165;99166;99191;99504;100755;100999;101051;104077;104087;104666;104853;105206;105493;105665"
