"DEM","Dementia","Read code ever recorded",131,"MEDCODES","This set of codes was based on two published dementia diagnosis lists (Grant e al, 2013; Khan et al 2010) plus a hand search using the CPRD medical diagnosis browser. Dr Jorge Brown and 2 GPs (Dr Duncan Edwards and Dr Rupert Payne) from the Cambridge Primary Care Unit revised the selection of codes for this study. 

Fifty-three codes where identified using previous published lists and another twelve codes were selected through the hand search. Codes identified through the hand search included new codes that described types of dementia already included in published lists, and alcohol related dementias not included in previous published lists. (small numbers were added, but all alcohol related dementia had previously been left off).",,,68,"1350;1916;1917;4357;4693;5931;6578;7323;7572;7664;8195;8634;8934;9509;9565;11136;11175;11379;12621;15165;16797;18386;19393;19477;21887;25386;25704;26270;26323;27342;27677;27759;28402;29386;30032;30706;31016;32057;33707;34944;37014;37015;38438;38678;41089;41185;42279;42602;43089;43292;43346;44674;46488;46762;48501;49263;49513;53446;54106;54505;55313;55467;55838;56912;59122;60059;61528;64267"
